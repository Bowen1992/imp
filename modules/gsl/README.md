\brief Several general purpose optimizers from the GNU Scientific Library (GSL).

The most useful is probably the IMP::gsl::Simplex optimizer. Note that GSL is licensed under the GPLv3, which requires that all other software linked with it also be licensed under a GPL-compatible license.

# GSL # {#GSL}
The IMP.gsl module requires [GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). It
is available as a prebuilt package on all supported platforms. Note that
GSL is distributed under the GPL and so cannot be used in C++ applications
with certain other dependencies such as CGAL.
