The main SPB executables are:

`spb`: this is the master program to generate structural models of the SPB core.

`spb_analysis`: this tool analyzes the models produced by the spb code and calculates various scores, including the fit to EM data not used in the generation of models;

`spb_cluster`: this program classifies the SPB models into clusters based on structural similarity (distance root mean square deviation, dRMSD);

`spb_density_perbead`: this tool produces localization density to be visualized with Chimera.
