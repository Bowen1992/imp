Supporting your code {#supporting}
====================

Once you have submitted code, you should monitor the [Nightly build
status](https://integrativemodeling.org/nightly/results/) to make sure that
your code builds on all platforms and passes the unit tests. Please
fix all build problems as fast as possible.

In addition to monitoring the [imp-dev list](https://integrativemodeling.org/contact.html),
developers may want to subscribe to the
[imp-commits list](https://integrativemodeling.org/contact.html),
list which receives notices of all changes made to the %IMP repository.
