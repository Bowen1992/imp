Good programming practices {#good_practice}
==========================

Two excellent sources for general C++ coding guidelines are

- [C++ Coding Standards](http://www.amazon.com/Coding-Standards-Rules-Guidelines-Practices/dp/0321113586) by Sutter and Alexandrescu

- [Effective C++](http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Specific-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0201924889) by Meyers

%IMP endeavors to follow all the of the guidelines published in those
books. If you are in the Sali lab, we own copies of both of these books which
you are free to borrow.
