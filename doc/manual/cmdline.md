Using command line tools {#cmdline}
========================

%IMP provides a number of programs to solve common modeling problems. These
are all designed to be run from a command line (such as a terminal window).
They do not have the flexibility of the full %IMP library, but are designed
to be much easier to use, and do not require any programming knowledge.
In many cases, web interfaces to the same functionality are also available.

Below, a number of the more commonly-used tools will be
demonstrated with worked examples.
There is a [full list of all such programs](@ref cmdline_tools) in the
Reference Guide.
