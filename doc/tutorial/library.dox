/**
\page library The IMP C++/Python library

The core of IMP is the C++/Python library, which provides all of the necessary
components, as a set of classes and modules, to allow methods developers to
build an integrative modeling protocol from scratch. Most users of IMP will
use one of the higher-level interfaces described in later sections of this
tutorial; however, we will briefly demonstrate this library here to illustrate
the core IMP concepts that these interfaces rely on.
