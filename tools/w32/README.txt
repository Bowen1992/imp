The installer will install IMP under a directory of your choosing.
For example, the FoXS fitting program is installed in the 'bin' subdirectory,
so can be run simply by opening a Command Prompt, changing to this bin
directory (or adding it to your PATH), and typing 'foxs'.

The IMP Python libraries are automatically set up to work with any version
of 32-bit Python from 2.4 to 2.7. (You need to download Python separately from
www.python.org and install it.) Note that IMP does *not* work with Python 3
or 64-bit Python. One easy way to run IMP Python scripts is to open them in
Python's IDLE program and run them by pressing F5.
